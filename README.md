Caml Diets
==================

A highly efficient OCaml set implementation for fat sets, i.e. densely populated sets over a discrete linear order.

It is developed and maintained by:
- (c) Oliver Friedmann, University of Munich (http://oliverfriedmann.de)
- (c) Martin Lange, University of Kassel (http://carrick.fmv.informatik.uni-kassel.de/~mlange/)

## Credits
The code for handling the AVL trees is borrowed from the Objective Caml Standard Library Set module.
